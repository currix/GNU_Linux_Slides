  \begin{block}{Defining and Exporting Variables in \texttt{Bash}}
    {\footnotesize 
Variables are
parameters that you can create and/or update yourself. Variable names or identifiers consist only of letters, digits and underscores; beginning with a letter or an underscore.

To store \texttt{value} in a variable named \texttt{varname }the following syntax is used:

        \begin{lstlisting}
varname=value
        \end{lstlisting}

To access data stored in a variable we proceed to
  parameter expansion using the special character \alert{\texttt{\$}} as
  in the following example.


        \begin{lstlisting}
alice@platea:~$ foo=bar
alice@platea:~$ echo "foo is $foo..."
foo is bar
\end{lstlisting}
%$

The \texttt{Bash} shell provides automatically a series
of variables called \alert{\emph{environment variables}} that affect the user session and
can be customized.}

      Environment variables modify important aspects of the interaction

  displays them.}

    {\scriptsize
  \alert{Global} variables are available in all shell sessions and \alert{local} variables are only available in the currently executing shell and will be lost once the user exits the session.

Some of the more important environment variables are the following
\begin{description}
\item[HOME] The current user's home directory, the default for the cd built-in. The value of this variable is also used by tilde expansion.
\item[PATH] A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands.
\item[PS1] The primary prompt string.
\item[HISTFILE] The name of the file to which the command history is
  saved. The default value is \texttt{\textasciitilde/.bash\_history}.
\item[HISTFILESIZE] The maximum number of lines contained in the history file, defaults to 500.
\end{description}

\note{
{\tiny
  Both local and global variables are case sensitive and usually capitalised. According to a convention, local variables should be kept lowercase and global variables should be kept uppercase. Although this is just a convention and you are free to keep any name for both local and global variables. A variable name cannot start with a number and should only contain characters in the beginning.
