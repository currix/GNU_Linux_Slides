\begin{frame}[t,fragile]{What is the private/public key approach?}
  % ------------------------------------------------------
  \begin{block}{Asymmetric Criptography}
    {\footnotesize
\alert{Asymmetric cryptography} (AC) solves what has always been one of the biggest problems in cryptography: \emph{How can you send someone a coded message without having an opportunity to previously share the code with them?}. AC is based on a pair of associated cryptographic
keys: a \alert{private} key and a \alert{public} key. 

\vspace{0.25cm}
A \textbf{public} key is part of the owner's digital certificate and \emph{it is available for anyone to use}. A \textbf{private} key, however, is protected by and \emph{available only to the owner of the key}. This limited access ensures that communications are kept secure.

\vspace{0.25cm}
The owner of a certificate can use the keys to take advantage of the
security features provided by AC. For example,
he can use a certificate's private key to ``sign''
and encrypt data sent between users and servers, such as messages,
documents, and code objects. The recipient of the signed object can
use the public key contained in the signer's certificate to
decrypt the signature. Such digital signatures ensure the reliability
of an object's origin providing a way of checking the object integrity.

{\tiny
Symmetric-key algorithms have their own applications, such as encrypting data for personal use, or for when there are secure channels that the private keys can be shared over.
